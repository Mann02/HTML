<!-- So this is the basic layout for HTML files. Lets now discuss what do these tags do
     First is our <html> tag, this tag basically the most essential tag of HTML files and every HTml code goes under this tag,
     if you didnt put this tag at first, maybe your HTML wont run
     
     Next is the <head> tag. Its like as its name suggests, the head of our websites. This tag is optional and you can
     remove it if you want but if you want to add title or other files to your HTML doc, you should use this tag
     
     Next is <title> tag. The title we  put inbetween these tags appear at top of our document. Look at the screenshot at README
     file for more details on what is title
     
     Next is our <body> tag and as the name suggests its the body of our document. Everything goes under our body tag
     
     **NOTE**: DO not forget to close HTML tags. Some of the tags in HTML do not require a closing tag </> but many do -->
